Objectives:
1. To create a Python code to solve the given problems using the Numpy Library.
2. Use Numpy to perform computations using arrays, finding the mean and the standard deviation.
3. Test the formulated codes using different values to ensure accuracy.

# Problem
1. Normalization Problem (Subtract X to the mean and divide by the standard deviation)
2. Divisible by 3 Problem

# Expected Outputs:
Normalization Problem
1. A random 5x5 array which will be used in the Normalization .
2. A 5x5 normalized Numpy array that is saved as X_normalized.npy.

Divisible by 3 Problem:
1. A 10x10 ndarray of the first 100 positive integers.
2. A Numpy array that contains the elements of A that are divisible by 3 and is saved as div_by_3.npy.
